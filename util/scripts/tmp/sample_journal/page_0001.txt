narrative to remind them pleasantly of that remarkable season of
our lives,—our ﬁve weeks abode in the Desert.

Sir G. Wilkinson must be almost tired of the testimonies and
thanks of grateful travelers: but I must just say that he was, by
his books, a daily benefactor to us in Egypt. It is really cheering
to ﬁnd that any one can be so accurate, and on so large a scale,
as his works prove him to be. Such almost faultless correctness
requires a union of intellectual and moral powers and training,
which it is encouraging for those who are interested in the results
of travel to contemplate. After making the fullest use of his
“Modern Egypt and Thebes,” we ﬁnd only about half-a-dozen
points in which we differ from him.

In regard to that difﬁcult matter,—-diﬂicult to those who do not
understand Arabic,—the spelling of the names of places and per-
sons in Egypt and Arabia,—I have done what every one will
allow to be the safest thing ;—I have followed the authority of
Mr. Lane wherever I could. If any English reader complains of
me for altering the look of familiar Egyptian names, it is enough
to reply that Mr. Lane knows better than any one, and that I c0py
from him. If I have departed from his method anywhere, it is
merely because I had not his authority before me in those par-
ticular instances.
